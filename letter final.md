# letter final

I opened up about two things:
my family situation: my dead father, my increasingly demented mother; and my need for agency in my romantic relationships

I don't have a backup plan, I need to work to support my family,
I'm moving to Chicago in april because I don't have any other options
my trauma is forcing me into situations and you seemed like a brave and courageous woman, that was so exciting, yet you're running from yours

AAAND i don't kiss just anyone, far from it. I've wanted a second date twice in the past six months AND I didn't even get to dance with you! AND you somehow flipped this on me!

why am I even writing this 

I feel betrayed

can't wait to awkwardly bump into you at a bar

# letter final

I opened up about two things:
my family situation: my dead father, and my increasingly demented mother; my need for agency in my romantic relationships

I don't have a backup plan, I need to work to support my family,
I'm facing my fears, you seemed like a courageous woman who was doing the same

I don't kiss just anyone, far from it.
I feel betrayed on all three fronts

# seamus setting up a page for Tim pool days

you paid me too much

I was expecting some blow back
I do feel like my x hours at $15 an hour was accurate and fair
but I was expecting you to question hundreds of dollars

so because of that ill do my next bits for free

I think one of our biggest problems is that
you don't know how much time things cost for me
in terms of man hours

I am trying to find a time price hour that works for me as well as my clients, , and splitting my time into either 1,2,3 x / day works well for me. 
I feel like $15/hr is fair, and while I sometimes feel like I don't accomplish much in a day, ive probably spent literally 2x the time I've charged, because I always found down, and everytime there's something I can't prove I exclude it, 

yet things like that happen alot, and I know I'm not in your dime
this work is complicated and I am trying to be honest and transparent




that being said
I think I could set you up with like a donate link per instance of timpoolShow

so you could track which days, got you paid
that's not hard



email thing isn't hard either, 
talk to me brother

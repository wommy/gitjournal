can boundaries be unhealthy? 

I had an ex reverse break up with me
( you can't fire me I quit )

I had called out how one sided the relationship had become
because I called out how the relationship was one sided

she spent all my time at her house doing her chores
and when I told her 

she told me that she wouldn't help me 

I feel like since my father's death in 2015
I've had a very strange relationship with my mother
borderline munchausen by proxy
where like my attempts to get away incur penalties

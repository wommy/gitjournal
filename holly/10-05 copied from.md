I don't even remember the fight, but you had some theater bizarre meeting and you stopped by my house after. that was one of the times I saw us going the distance. I really appreciated your willingness to come to the table

I really don't understand what happened at all

I miss everything, holding your hands, sleeping with you, going to home teapot 

I know I did a great harm, it was my fault and I take responsibility

I do not believe your actions on that last Friday we're good pure or chaste but you had alot on your plate

soooo

I just wanted to say that I'm totally cool with you

I like you 

I feel crazy for even texting you right now

but I have a big feel about you

I'm cool with your trauma, and thank you for sharing it
I must be kinda special

what I'm not cool with is how it went down

I totally get that I freaked out
but it wasn't about the content of what you said
it was about the delivery 

I spent a good chunk of my Thursday with you 
Friday I wasted all day with my sister and then the whole ky snaffu in the evening
that threw me off bigly too, your feels about the whole situation was spot on, ky stresses me out too,
but ive known her for a while

anyway because I work for myself there isn't a clock in and a clock out
so like I really had to make Saturday count
I don't expect you read my mind about that either
is there a little to 

I really need to head down on this project
the reason I'm in Chicago is because my mom is unstable
I really need to put priority on my work
I need a stable environment

that's what was so upsetting to me,
I had a pretty productive morning and I was looking to carry that good energy into the afternoon and you blindsided me

I get that the topic was stressful for you,
I get that it takes alot of guts to talk about that stuff
so I'm sorry for how I responded 
but like

it's not just on me, 
you have to take a little responsibility

whatever you told me about I can deal with 
what I can't deal with is potentiinal partner who can't admit some fault

I've been completely consumed with this,
and I bet you have too

I'm not looking to change you or anything,
I'm just trying to express a boundary
I'm trying to be healthy 

a potential partner should be a benefit 
a person whom you're trying to 

I don't know what's healthy for you but I'm willing to listen if you are


my last relationship ended because it was extremely one sided,
the one thing I brought up is how I need my partners to hear my feedback

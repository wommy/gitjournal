I'm sorry about your trauma
I'm sorry about how I reacted
if you couldn't tell you hit a nerve

I came to Chicago to try to get some peace and quiet to work on my project
and this beautiful woman that I had the beginning of a connection with 
blasted me with all this trauma
which in turn triggered all this trauma

that's why I called you rude. because I was on the run from mine
and you triggered it 

I'm sorry
I'm working on myself and I know youre working on you
I acknowledge your courage 

have a nice life

# letter

I apologize

I'm super sorry

I didn't mean to minimize your trauma

and I certainly didn't mean to unveil a whole new trauma about you trying to talk about your trauma, esp to new partners

I get that it,
the whole ky restaurant thing brought up some bad feels,
and the next day you wanted to try to smooth those out,
I felt the same way, that's why I texted you that stuff after, that was my way of attempting to smooth it out

I didn't have any problem with you not coming,
I get that it was a little weird but I liked everything I saw in you
I only reached out later that night to try to smooth them out
but I can imagine why you were trying to smooth it out from your side

I never got to thank you for telling me, for letting me in
I tried to text you about it but I don't think you got them

that's why I'm writing this to you
I just want to say my part like how you go to say yours

everything you opened up to me about I'm cool with and always was
me flipping out wasn't about the content of what you delivered
I just have my own trauma about being interrupted while working
I told you how I was here because my mother's probably coming down with dementia
I came to Chicago to get some peace and quiet so I could work
so when you dumped that story on me,
when you opened up to me,
I got upset because I was finally working on something

I'm totally cool with you, I like everything about you, there's not anything you could say or do that changes the big feel that you awakened in me

I'm really upset about how everything went down that wasn't my intention, I'm really upset at myself for behaving how I did 

I too like to take a day or two to process stuff that's why i said I'd text you later

but you have to realize that I'm a person with a past too
I'm not talking to control you or anything you think, I'm just trying to set up some healthy boundaries so that something good can grow
I have needs too, I need to feel safe too

?
I've been on so many dates in the past 6 months and you're the only person that I wanted to go on a second one with,

I like everything I saw in you, I was really hoping and looking forward to getting to learn all the things about you, 
you interested me, and that's something that's really rare












I'm sorry I ignored you saying don't come to my house, but I wanted to get something off my chest, like how you wanted to get your trauma off yours
-
I need to get something off my chest, I think you know the feel


I really hope you read this instead of just throwing it out 



I'm moving back to the city the beginning of april

just think about this for a day or two like I did,
it's been a week and I still can't stop thinking about this 
I can't convey enough how sorry I am, I made a huge mistake 

I'm not trying to make you my girlfriend or anything like that either,
I just would like to opportunity to explore what got so rudely interrupted by my actions, I had butterflies in my stomach after meeting you. I just want the opportunity to continue down that path

you're a march aries, you have big explosive feels and I'm really trying to be there for em, I'm trying to bring everything I can to the table 
I'm pretty grounded and not easily swayed and I think that could valuable to you 

whenever I have big bad feels around something, I know that love and care, those can turn into big good feels

I really didn't mean to upset you I know it took alot to open up
you were playing it safe and I super respect that, I'm sorry that me trying to smooth it over led to you wanting to explain yourself, to justify your actions 

I don't think we have, I don't think we're that far off from each other,
I think it's a big shame to throw away something that could be, that feels like it has the potential to be something great

another trauma, another thing from my past is wanting to have a part of the say in my future relationships, I told you how my mom bossed my dad around. I don't want to, I don't think I can be a part of something in where one person calls the shots. it's super important for me for my potential future partners know that I'm not sticking my neck out for no reason. I don't think, I'm just trying, aiming, for stability and, that was my intentions of what I texted back to you 

I fight for, I stand up for what I think is right. I'm the day of moral courage, and it takes alot of courage to come back to you like this 
this is a hard thing for me, but I'm trying to grow into the person I know I can be 

if you don't respond I'll understand but I really hope you read this and want to text me, I really would like the opportunity to try to start fresh, yet continue where we left off, I had real high hopes for you and I think that you saw something in me too
I think it's silly to throw this away, if we can get past this, if we cnsnlearn from this, I think it would be really hard for anything else to get in our way,
and I get that sometimes it's easier to just cut and run, and start fresh when something this terrible happens right at the start, but I'm looking to build something, and I'm not a quitter

anyway whatever you choose I want you to know that I think you're great and I wish you well and hope you have great success in life and all your endeavors,
it would at least be nice to bump into you at a bar, all this, this all feels like wasted potential, like a rocket blowing up on the launchpad
-
I wish you read this and we at least bump into each other at a bar or something because 
-
I was so looking forward to getting to know you, to learning what makes to tick

I hope you can find it in you to forgive me,
with the most sincere apology
tommy




I know I try to come off and cool and collected 
but I have a bunch of feels under my exterior
and I know you got to see some of the less pleasant ones 
but I really want to show you

I have alot of feels too
sometimes it's really hard to feel 
that's not my strong point, but I'm really trying

I know you know what a WaWa is




when I'm working I'm in a super analytical troubleshooting mood
I'm trying to get the bottom of things
I fix problems for a living

so if you come at me during that, I'm not gonna meet you with understanding and compassion, I'm in kill mode 

that's why I said it was rude, that's why I acted how I did

I don't want to bore you with this shit or go over a fresh wound for kicks, I'm not looking for a pass, I'm just trying to explain it












I'm so sorry sarah

I didn't mean for that to go that way
I wasn't trying to berate you or control you or minimize your trauma

my reaction had nothing to do with you, it was all about the stuff that I was dealing with around my mom, one of the only things I told you how I came to Chicago because I needed to yet couldn't focus on my work

and then you trying to nip that hard on a good day conversation in the bud set me off 
that's why I got upset

and like I know we all have stuff were working on
but I felt really good just being around you
and I get why you'd want to get anything problematic out of the way

that's why I told you about my mom

I just wanted to let you know that you shouldn't be scared to show people who you are, all I ask if that
all I want is a little compassion towards my own past

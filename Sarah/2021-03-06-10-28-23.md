# letter

I'm so sorry sarah

I just wanted to let you know, to clarify that it wasn't about what you said, but that it was about the stuff I'm dealing with on my end
that you should be confident in opening up and sharing who you are and how you got here

my anger and general upset stems around why I'm in Chicago in the first place, to escape my mom so I can buckle down and work

I had a really good time with you, I wouldn't be writing this if I didn't,
I feel like there was so much potential
I would love to try again, but that balls in your court

I'm moving here in april, stew on it, there's no rush

I hope you can find it in you to forgive me,
with the most sincere apology
tommy

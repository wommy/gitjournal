# letter

I'm so sorry sarah

I just wanted to let you know, to clarify, that it wasn't about what you said, but that it was about the stuff I'm dealing with in my life

you should have confidence in opening up and sharing who you are and how you got here

my anger and general upset stems around why I'm in Chicago in the first place, to escape my mom so I can buckle down and work

I had a really good time with you, I wouldn't be writing this if I didn't,
I feel like there was so much potential
I would love to try again, but that ball is in your court

so stew on it, there's no rush, 
maybe our paths will cross when I move back here in april,
if not, I hope to at least benefit you with this apology

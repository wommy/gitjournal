# letter

Sarah, I'm so sorry

I just wanted to let you know, to clarify, that i freaked out about the stuff I'm dealing with in my life, not about what you shared

you should have confidence in opening up and sharing who you are and how you got here

my anger stemmed from why I'm in Chicago in the first place, to escape my mom so I can buckle down and work

I had a great time with you, I wouldn't be writing this if I didn't feel like I'm wasting such huge potential
it's up to you now, but I would love to try again

so stew on it, there's no rush, 
maybe our paths will cross when I move back here in april,
if not, I hope you at least find benefit in this apology

tommy

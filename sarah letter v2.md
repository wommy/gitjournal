# sarah letter v2

God damnit you fucking bitch
I don't even want to give this to you anymore

I had a real good time with you for one fucking day
and I'm still thinking about it a week later

why'd you have to go and be crazy and somehow suck me in


---

I have a specific type and I'm pretty sure you're it
but I can't go and explore that anymore

I've spent the last six months looking for someone,  
I don't want to go and date just anyone,
I've literally been on 20-30 dates in that time, and you're only the second one that I've thought about the day after 

I don't care about your trauma,
I have my own and I literally told you about it and you somehow still stuck your finger in it,
I told you how I was in chicago to get away from my mom so I can focus on work 

and you had to fucking text me a goddamn block,
and yeah I reacted piss-poorly but it had nothing to do with what you said

I don't care about your trauma, 
but youre fucking mental for treating me this way,

I'm so mad if you can't tell,
we probably wouldn't have gotten along
